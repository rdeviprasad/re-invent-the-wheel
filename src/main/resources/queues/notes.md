# Queue
It is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First In First Out) principle. The element that is inserted first is the first one to be removed.

## Operations
1. Enqueue: Insert an element into the queue.
2. Dequeue: Remove an element from the queue.
3. Peek: Get the front element of the queue without removing it.
4. isEmpty: Check if the queue is empty.
