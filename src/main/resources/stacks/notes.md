# Stack

It is a linear data structure. It works on the principle of LIFO (Last In First Out). The element that is inserted last is the first one to be removed.

## Operations
1. Push: Insert an element into the stack.
2. Pop: Remove an element from the stack.
3. Peek: Get the top element of the stack without removing it.
4. isEmpty: Check if the stack is empty.
